<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>I am currently a PhD student of the Department of Computer Science and Technology in [Nanjing University](http://www.nju.edu.cn/) and a member of [R&L Group](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/rl/index.htm), led by Professor [Yang Gao](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/gaoyang/index.htm) and [Jing Huo](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/huojing/index.htm). I received my Bachelor's degree in June 2017 and my Master's degree in June 2020, both from [Soochow University](https://www.suda.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Professor [Zongzhang Zhang](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/zhangzongzhang/index.htm). From November 2024, I will begin a one-year visiting at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) under the supervision of Professor [Lin Shao](https://linsats.github.io/).

My research interest includes **robot learning**, **reinforcement learning** and **imitation learning**. Specifically, I am interested in two robot learning problems: 1) How to leverage prior knowledge to enhance a robot's capability in long-horizon tasks. 2）How to enable a robot to possess highly generalizable spatial intelligence in 3D environments.
